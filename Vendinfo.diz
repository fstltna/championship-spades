MAJOR REVIEWS/AWARDS FOR CHAMPIONSHIP SPADES

"When I ran into Championship Spades, I had to give it a try. I was
amazed from the beginning...The background music is wonderful, and the
use of miscellaneous sounds throughout the game really enhance the card
playing experience.  In addition, the game layout is easy to get use to
and I absolutely love the different graphic backgrounds...This game is
definitely one of the World's Best Shareware around!"
-- Shareware Shop

"One of the most versatile Spades games I've played, you can set
the attributes of your opponents to go easy on you or be totally
ruthless. With sandbag limit, minimum bids, handicap, and 10 for 200
penalty, you can't get a more complete game. There's also an almost
adventure like atmosphere with the added MIDI sounds.  Rated 5 stars!"
-- Shareware Gems

"Editors Pick: 4 stars.  Championship Spades 95 is a polished, fun
Spades card game. Using graphical images for players, you play on a
colorful screen, choosing from one of eight faces."
-- ZDNet (major computer magazine publisher)
