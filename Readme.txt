UPGRADES:
We highly recommend that people upgrading from older versions first 
uninstall the previous version.  Even if you uninstall, your name and
register key will be automatically transferred over.  Since this release
replaced most artwork/sounds, you will save hard disk space and prevent
duplicate files by uninstalling first BEFORE installing this release.

HOW TO UNINSTALL:
To uninstall, use Start->Settings->Control Panel->Add/Remove Programs
and select Championship Spades.  Your autosave games will not be
uninstalled.  You should manually delete the Championship Spades 
directory if you do not want these files after you have used the
uninstall program.  If for some reason the standard uninstall does fail,
you may safely just delete the Spades directory manually.  

DIFFERENT INSTALLATION LEVELS IN SETUP PROGRAM:
Full:    Includes public-domain MIDI songs, game sounds, and player taunts.
Minimal: Includes all critical game files but no sounds or MIDI files.
Custom:  Allows you to selectively choose which components you wish to use.
Suggest: Additional MIDI files (pack of top 200) are also available from our 
         site in SpMidiPk.exe (1.5 MB) from http://www.dq.com/spdown.shtml

INSTALLATION FROM A SELF-EXTRACTING ZIP (EXE) FILE:
Simply double-click on the EXE.  Select Setup and then specify the

and allow you to start playing.  You can now safely delete spades32.exe
to conserve disk space.  If you have problems extracting and installing,
try unzipping the EXE first using WinZip or PkUnzip and then follow the
diskette installation instructions below.
